# DASH-Test

# Running the experiments

To run the experiments, you need to:

1. Clone this repository
2. Obtain a video dataset and a media presentation description file. You can do that by <code>make gen_mpd</code> 
3. Create a results folder in the project root called <code>mn_res</code>
4. Run the <code>init_and_run.sh</code> script (this will take a while)

# Plotting the results

To plot the results you can use the analise.py script. It takes a in_file via the <code>fname</code> flag, out_file via the <code>out</code> flag.
