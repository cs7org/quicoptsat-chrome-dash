# DASH-Test

# Running the experiments

To run the experiments, you need to:

1. Clone this repository
2. Obtain a DASH encoded data-set and place it within a directory path: <code>bbb_1.0/1.0/</code> relative from project's root
3. Obtain a mpd (media presentation document file) and place it within a the <code>bbb_1.0/</code> directory. The MPD file needs to be called: <code>bbb.mpd</code>
4. run the <code>init_and_run.sh</code> script (this will take a while)

# Plotting the results

To plot the results you can use analise.py script. It takes a in_file via the <code>fname</code> flag, out_file via the <code>out</code> flag.
