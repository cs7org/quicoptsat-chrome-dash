# quicoptsat-chrome-dash

Run Chrome loading a website with a `dash.js` client and send metrics to an HTTP server


## Files to be served by (QUIC) web server

 - `player.html`, see `scripts` directory
 - `dash.all.debug.js`, see `scripts` directory or https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/releases/tag/v4.7.4
 - `mpd` and `m4s` video files in `data` directory; can be generated by running `make stage1-mpd` (takes some time)


## Run and evaluate experiments

- Run experiments with `python3 chrome-dash_run.py`
- Evaluate json files with `python3 chrome-dash_eval.py`

FIXME: Length of video streaming experiment must be specified in `player.html` and `chrome-dash_run.py`
