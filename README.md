# quicoptsat-chrome-dash

Run automated Chrome and load a website with a `dash.js` client using HTTP/2 TCP or HTTP/3 QUIC (with or without Careful Resume)

Metrics:
 - [PerformanceTiming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming) (providing absolute time stamps)
 - dash.js [MediaPlayerEvents](https://cdn.dashjs.org/latest/jsdoc/MediaPlayerEvents.html)


## Files to be served by HTTP/2 and/or HTTP/3 web server

 - `player.html`, see `scripts` directory
 - `dash.all.debug.js`, see `scripts` directory or https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/releases/tag/v4.7.4
 - `mpd` and `m4s` video files in `data` directory; can be generated by running `make stage1-mpd` (takes some time)


## Run and evaluate experiments

- Run experiments with `python3 chrome-dash_run.py` (settings within script, contains HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 [Picoquic CR](https://github.com/hfstco/picoquic/tree/cr) configuration)
- Evaluate json files with `python3 chrome-dash_eval.py`
